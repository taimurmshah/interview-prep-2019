Here, there are 3-4 objects. They are:
1. Student
2. School
3. Contract
4. ContractAdjustment

The prompt wants me to create a method on Contract that discounts the contract terms.

Reduce Ambiguity:
1. WHO is going to be using this?
    - A student drops out. Does Leif go to a school and say, "yo, Mohamed just dropped out. Can we readjust?"
        - OR does a school do the readjusting? as in, Mohamed just dropped out, let us adjust his contract
          so that he doesn't owe us as much money; let's discount his shit.
    Determination: School will be using this.
2. HOW will this be used?
    - Does a school admin log into their Leif account, look at the contracts, select one, and choose to discount it?
        - If so, what does that look like? Do they have search functionality to find a student? (probably)
        - Does Leif have rules as to how a discount can be structured? As in, how does a discount work?
    - What are the specifics of the discount? What properties of a contract can be discounted?
        - percentIncomeShare
        - paymentCap
        - contractLength (might be a better name for this)
3. WHY?
    - A student gets a contract with a school with particular terms; he doesn't complete the program, so the school
      wants to discount his contract; they don't want him to pay the full amount.

So, where do I start? The prompt asks me to write a method on Contract called discount.
    1. I create the Contract class.
        - What are the properties?
            - paymentCap
            - percentIncomeShare
            - contractLength
    2. I create a method called discountContract().
        - at a high level, what is this method doing?
            - this method is changing one or many of the contract particulars
        - What are the inputs?
        - What is the return value?
    3. Does there need to be a record of changes made to a contract? If a student owed 15K, but now he owes 5K,
       does that information need to be tracked? It seems like it should -- there should be a history of what has
       happened.
        - if so, how and where will this data be stored?
            - imagine a new class, maybe ContractAdjustment
